Usable as an Addin in RStudio. You can select it from a menu at the top,
when this package is installed. If you're currently selecting the name of a
data frame in your source code, this will be the dataset shown by default.
If you don't select text, you can pick a dataset from a dropdown.
You can add a keyboard shortcut for this command by following the
\href{https://support.posit.co/hc/en-us/articles/206382178-Customizing-Keyboard-Shortcuts-in-the-RStudio-IDE}{instructions}
by RStudio. How about Cmd+Ctrl+C?
