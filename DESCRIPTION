Title: Automatic Codebooks from Survey Metadata Encoded in Attributes
Description: Easily automate the following tasks to describe data frames: 
  summarise the distributions of scales and items graphically and using descriptive statistics,
  compute reliabilities (internal consistencies, retest, multilevel) for psychological scales, 
  combine this information with metadata (such as item labels and labelled values) that is derived from R attributes.
  To do so, the package relies on 'rmarkdown' partials, so you can generate HTML, PDF, and Word documents. Codebooks
  are also available as tables (CSV, Excel, etc.).
  The metadata and codebooks are also available at your fingertips via RStudio Addins.
